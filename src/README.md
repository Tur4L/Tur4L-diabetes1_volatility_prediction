<h2>
gp.py
</h2>
I have tried Gaussian Processing here. Currently, data is too big for a simple GP. I will attempt different GP methods in the future.

<h2>
arima.py
</h2>
I have implemented the ARIMA model here. Currently, running into a convergence problem.

<h2>
graph_data.py
</h2>
I have implemented graph_data() and length_data() functions. They can be used for length-of-line analysis.
